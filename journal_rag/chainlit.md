# Welcome to your Journal Assistant!

This is a RAG application built with Ollama and Chainlit to help you with your weekly journal review.

**How to use:**

1.  Make sure your journal entries are in the `data` directory.
2.  Ask questions about your journal entries in the chat.

For example, you can ask:
*   "What were my biggest accomplishments last week?"
*   "Summarize my entries from the last 7 days."
*   "What was I thinking about on Monday?"
