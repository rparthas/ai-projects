# Product Requirements Document: Toddler Activity Planner

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "Toddler Activity Planner," a multi-agent system designed to assist parents in planning engaging and well-coordinated weekend activities for their toddlers in Bengaluru. The system will be accessible through a simple web application. This project is inspired by the user's role as a father and serves as a practical application of multi-agent architectures.

## 2. Problem Statement

Parents of young children often spend a significant amount of time and effort planning weekend activities. This process involves multiple considerations, including checking the weather, finding age-appropriate and engaging activities, and locating suitable kid-friendly restaurants nearby. This can be a fragmented and time-consuming process.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To simplify and automate the process of planning a toddler-friendly weekend day.
*   **Secondary Goal:** To serve as a hands-on project to explore and implement multi-agent architectures, including Hierarchical, Collaborative, and potentially the Diamond Pattern.

## 4. Target Audience

*   **Primary User:** Parents of toddlers residing in or visiting Bengaluru.

## 5. Features and Requirements

### 5.1. User Interface

*   A simple web application will serve as the front-end for the user to interact with the system.
*   The user will be able to input their preferences through the web app.

### 5.2. Core Agent Capabilities

*   **Orchestrator Agent:**
    *   Acts as the central coordinator of the multi-agent system.
    *   Interprets the user's high-level request (e.g., "plan a fun Saturday for my toddler").
    *   Accepts user inputs for the toddler's age (defaulting to 3) and dietary preferences (defaulting to vegetarian).
    *   Delegates tasks to specialized agents in a logical sequence.

*   **Weather Agent:**
    *   Fetches the weather forecast for a specified weekend in Bengaluru.

*   **Activity Agent:**
    *   Searches for activities, parks, or events in Bengaluru that are age-appropriate based on the user's input.

*   **Restaurant Agent:**
    *   Finds kid-friendly restaurants in proximity to the activity location chosen by the Activity Agent.
    *   Filters restaurants based on the user's dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian).

*   **Response Mixer Agent:**
    *   Receives and synthesizes the outputs from the Weather, Activity, and Restaurant agents.
    *   Generates a cohesive plan for the day in the format of a schedule with timings.

### 5.3. Error Handling

*   If no suitable activities are found, the system should clearly communicate this to the user.
*   If no suitable restaurants are found, the system should still provide the activity plan and notify the user about the restaurant search.

## 6. Out of Scope for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

*   **Rephraser Agent (Diamond Pattern):**
    *   This feature, which would rephrase the plan in a child-friendly tone, is a stretch goal and not required for the initial version.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   **Technical Success:** Successful implementation of the multi-agent (hierarchical and collaborative) architecture using LangChain.
*   **Output Quality:** The system consistently generates reasonable and logical plans that are helpful to the user.

## 8. Technical Stack (Proposed)

*   **Core Framework:** LangChain for multi-agent orchestration.
*   **Language Models (LLMs):** Open-source models like Llama 3, Mistral, or Mixtral, accessible via local instances (`ollama`, `HuggingFace Transformers`) or cloud APIs.
*   **Tools and APIs:**
    *   **Weather:** Python `requests` library with the Open-Meteo API.
    *   **Activity/Restaurant Search:** Web search libraries (`duckduckgo-search`, `serpapi`, `google-search`), web scraping libraries (`BeautifulSoup`), and potentially geospatial libraries (`OSMnx`, `Nominatim`).
